number = 5 #variable (number) stores value 5
print("I have thought of a number between 1 and 10") #print statement
guess = int(input("Can you guess what it is?")) #ask the user to input his guessing


if guess < number: #if the guessing is lower than the (number), the brogram will print too low!
  print("Too Low!")
if guess > number: #if the guessing is higher than the (number), the brogram will print too highe!
